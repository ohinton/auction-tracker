# ðŸŽ† Reach Your Fundraising Auction Goals ðŸŽ†

#### By Olivia Hinton | September 9, 2016

## Known Bugs
* Don't sign up, log in with **email: test@email.com, password: password** to access site.

* In User model, I would like to use "after_create :make_volunteer" to create the user-volunteer association when someone signs up.

>  Currently I get this error:
ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved in Devise::RegistrationsController#create
Failed to save the new associated volunteer.

> I've checked the database and model relationships, and the model specs are passing. Not sure why it won't create a volunteer after a user is signed up.

* When adding an update to a donor on the index page, I'm currently only able to add the update to the most recent donor created. I can't figure out another way to access the specific donor other than having this in the UpdatesController: @donor = Donor.where(volunteer_id: @volunteer.id).last

* Having issues with specs, specifically with the hidden form fields for setting up the relationship via ids. I believe some issues would be solved by figuring out the user-volunteer association issue.
